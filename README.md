# MASPER
This project aims to design a tool called MASSPR. It helps researchers to deal with time-consuming daily tasks. It is the process of using search engines to find relevant papers for their studies. Our tool turns manual browsing on the web to seek scientific articles into a fully automatic task. It can search over the web and download papers. Moreover, it filters all the downloaded documents to recommend the most relevant based on intelligent new mechanisms.
